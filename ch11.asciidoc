## Networking

The peer-to-peer network that Bitcoin runs on is what gives it a lot of its robustness. XXX nodes are running on the network as of this writing and communicate constantly.

The Bitcoin network is a broadcast network or a gossip network. Every node is constantly announcing different transactions, blocks and peers that it knows about. The protocol is rich and has a lot of features that have been added to it over the years.

The nice thing about the networking protocol is that it is not consensus critical. The same data can be sent from one node to another in some other fashion and the blockchain itself would not be affected.

With that in mind, let's start with the very first message that one node sends to another, the version message.

### Network Messages

Network messages have a particular form that looks like this

image:network1.png[Network Message]

The first four bytes are always the same and are referred to as the *network magic*. Magic bytes are common in network programming as the communication can be spotty and asynchronous. Magic bytes give the receiver a place to start should the communication get interrupted. Magic bytes are also useful to make sure the node is on the right network. You would not want a Bitcoin node to connect to a Litecoin node, for example. Thus, a Litecoin node has a differnt magic. Same thing with testnet, as the magic on the testnet network is different than mainnet.

The next 12 bytes define the command, or what the payload actually carries. There are many different payloads, many of which can be seen at https://wiki.bitcoin.it. Note that the command is meant to be human-readable and in fact this message is "version" in ascii with 0-byte padding.

The next 4 bytes determine the length of the payload. As we saw in the transaction and block parsing sections, this is necessary as the field is of variable length. As 2^32^ is about 4 billion, we can have payloads that can be as big as 4 GB. Note the number is interpreted in little-endian, so in our case here, that is 101 bytes.

The next 4 bytes are the checksum. The checksum algorithm is something of an odd choice as it's the first 4 bytes of the double-sha256 of the payload. I say odd, as normally, networking protocol checksums generally are designed to have error-correcting capability and double-sha256 has none. That said, the hash function is common in the rest of the protocol and is thus used here.

The code to handle network messages requires us to create a new class:

[source,python]
----
NETWORK_MAGIC = b'\xf9\xbe\xb4\xd9'
TESTNET_NETWORK_MAGIC = b'\xf9\xbe\xb4\xd9'

class NetworkEnvelope:

    def __init__(self, command, payload):
        self.command = command
        self.payload = payload

    def __repr__(self):
        return '{}: {}'.format(
            self.command.decode('ascii'),
            self.payload.hex(),
        )
----

#### Exercise {counter:exercise}

Determine what this network message is:

f9beb4d976657261636b000000000000000000005df6e0e2

#### Exercise {counter:exercise}

Write the `parse` and `serialize` methods for `NetworkEnvelope`.

### Parsing the payload

Each command has a separate payload specification. Here is the one for version:

The fields for version are meant to give enough information for two nodes to be able to be able to communicate.

###

Here is the one for inv:

TODO inv payload spec

The idea is that nodes know how to actually send and receive such payloads wrapped inside a network envelope. A fully functional bitcoin node needs to know what to do with every possible network message.

### Network handshake

The network handshake for two nodes is how node communication is established. It goes something like this:

 * A wants to connect to B and sends the version message.
 * B receives the version message and responds with the verack message and sends its own version message.
 * A receives the version and verack messages and continues communication

Once the handshake is finished, A and B can communicate however they want. Note that there is no authentication here and it's up to the nodes to verify all data that come in themselves. A node sending a bad tx or block, for example, can expect to get banned by other nodes.

### Connecting to the network

Network communication is tricky due to its asynchronous nature. To experiment, we can establish a connection to a random node on the network synchronously, however:

TODO show code

Connecting this way will only really show a little bit of data. Furthermore, we can't send until we've received and can't respond intelligently to more than 1 message at a time. A more robust implementation looks like this

TODO show code

TODO show code to download headers

TODO do exercise to validate each header?
